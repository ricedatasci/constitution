\section{Name and Purpose}

\subsection{Name}
The name of this organization is \underline{Rice DataSci}, commonly abbreviated
RDS.

\subsection{Purpose}

RDS will be the club supporting Data Science activities at Rice, specifically 
striving to:
\begin{enumerate} 

  \item Develop Rice University students into sophisticated data analysts
    through hands on projects and educational events;

  \item Broadly encourage numerical literacy, clear communication, and
    teamwork among Rice Students in an exceedingly data-driven world;
  
  \item Foster community and create a unified social hub for the broader Rice
    Data Science community; and
  
  \item Provide networking opportunities within industry and academia for
    internship, job and research opportunities.

\section{Organizational Structure}

\subsection{Workshops}

RDS will organize 2-3 high-quality workshops per semester.  These workshops
will be 2-3 hour long sessions which focus on a specific element of a Data
Scientist's workflow.  Ideally, these workshops should be designed so that each
attendee will leave with the knowledge and machinery to go from ``data''
$\rightarrow$ ``results''.  The topics / datasets chosen for a workshop should
be at least somewhat motivated by club member feedbck.  While all club officers
are encouraged to help design and implement these workshops, the Internal Vice
President shall lead this effort.

\subsection{Speakers}

RDS will host 1-2 high-quality speakers from academia or industry per semester.  The
topics of course, will ultimatly be chosen by the speaker, but suggestions should
be at least somewhat motivated by club member feedback.  Club members are encouraged
to interact with the speaker.  While all club officers are encouraged to help
source and secure speakers, the External Vice President shall lead this effort.

\subsection{Datathon}

RDS will host a Datathon in the Spring Semester of the current term.  The
Datathon should take place before Officer Election.  The Datathon will be a
collaboration between RDS and the newly formed Rice Data2Knowledge Lab.  

\subsection{Office Hours}

RDS will host weekly office hours to promote a community among its members.
All officers should try to make themselves available for at least 1 hour per
week.  Ideally officers can blanket a contiguous 2 hour timespan.  All RDS
members are encouraged to stop by for help with Data Science related
schoolwork, personal projects, or professional advice.

officer explicitly invites them to a specific event or activity.
